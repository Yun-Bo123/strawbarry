Our group found strawberry chemical data from the USDA website. We cleaned the NA values, organized the data structure, and adjusted the positions of the column names in the table. Then, we selected our group’s topic—“other chemicals”—and located its specific values. Together, we discussed and interpreted the meanings of the column names. After that, each of us conducted analyses, including comparing chemical usage between organic and conventional strawberries in each state and examining the trends by state over the years.
