The *Other Chemicals* dataset contains 12,969 observations and 21 variables. An initial quality assessment was performed to identify missing values and duplicate records. Approximately 42.9% of all entries were missing, mainly from location-related columns such as *County*, *Zip Code*, *Ag District*, and *Week Ending*, which were entirely empty. These variables were likely excluded in the original USDA data due to aggregation at a higher geographic level.

In contrast, key analytical variables --- including *Program*, *Year*, *Commodity*, *Data Item*, *Domain*, and *Value* --- were complete with no missing observations. This indicates that the core measurement data are reliable and can be safely used for further analysis.

No duplicate rows were detected, suggesting that the dataset is internally consistent and free from redundant entries. A cleaned version of the dataset was created by removing unnecessary columns and saving the result as **\"other_chemicals_clean_basic.csv\"** for subsequent analysis.
